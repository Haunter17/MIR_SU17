# Benchmark Tools for Representations

## Overview
The purpose of this set of benchmark tools is to help analyze the performace of different representations of an album track.
There are three major scripts for running the tool:

* [benchmarkDriver.m](https://github.com/Haunter17/MIR_SU17/blob/master/exp7/benchmark/benchmarkDriver.m)
* [statPlot.py](https://github.com/Haunter17/MIR_SU17/blob/master/exp7/benchmark/statPlot.py)
* [matchPctPlot.py](https://github.com/Haunter17/MIR_SU17/blob/master/exp7/benchmark/matchPctPlot.py)

## Calling the benchmark driver
The benchmark driver first computes the CQT coefficients for all audio tracks provided, and it learns the filters (model) for different representations, which is used for benchmark analysis. Then, it computes the representation on an arbitrarily chosen song with the clean album track and different distorted versions. Next, it generates a report that contains
* correlation statistics for each bit in the representation for the clean album track
* percentage of ones for each bit in the representation for the clean album track
* percentage of bits that match between each distorted and the clean version

The benchmark driver will request the following user input:

1. Flag number for the system (1 = hashprint, 2 = randomized, 3 = AE ...)

2. Name of the model file to write and read (without including ".mat")

3. Name of the output file to dump the report (without including ".out")

For instance, to call the autoencoder representation with the model file `AE_relu.mat` and output file `AE_relu_test.out`, the combination of user input will be "3, AE_relu, AE_relu_test".


## Plotting correlation and bit statistics
The python script [statPlot.py](https://github.com/Haunter17/MIR_SU17/blob/master/exp7/benchmark/statPlot.py) helps visualize the bit correlation and percentage statistics. Enter the following command in terminal to generate plots for the statistics:

```
  python3 statPlot.py <correlation_list> <pct_of_ones_list>
```

where the correlation and bit percentage statistics can be obtained from the `.out` file generated by the benchmark driver.

Notice that the lists have to be passed in as strings, with each element separated by a comma. An example call to the script is shown as following:

```
  python3 statPlot.py '0.66, 0.67, 0.35, ... , 0.65' '0.49, 0.51, 0.55, ... , 0.48'
```
